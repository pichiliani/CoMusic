    /// as keys.  If an object is put inside the array, it is pushed to other copies
    /// of the dictionary connected to the same network and channel.  If an object is
    /// taken from the array, the latest cached copy is returned.  If there is no
    /// cached copy yet (that is, if the client is relatively new), then null is returned,
    /// but the object is requested from other shared dictionaries on the network and 
    /// channelId.  The emergent behaviour is a very simple shared dictionary that performs
    /// extremely fast reads but expensive writes, and is ideal for non-streaming datasets.
    /// Examples of information that would be great to store in this dictionary would be
    /// user information like colour, preferences, avatar appearance, and object descriptions.
    /// Consistancy is achieved by assuming that each client only writes to their own keys,
    /// like "myclientname/objectname/whatever", or that writes are infrequeny enough that
    /// there is very little chance that two client will try to write to an object at the same
